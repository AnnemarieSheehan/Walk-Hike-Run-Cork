        <p class="card-text">Charles Fort Walk is a nice coastal path walk with fantastic views at every turn from Kinsale town to the Charles Fort. The walk begins at the fort, a trail winds down to the sea and continues along the bay as far as the Kinsale boat yard. Crossing the yard, the trail continues winding upwards with stunning views overlooking the bay. You then arrive at seclueded beach which offers the perfect resting place mid way on your hike or run. To continue the trail, follow the road a little way uphill until you see a small plank that works as a makeshift bridge across a small ditch. The trail continues uphill until you arrive at an open field, take a moment to breath the fresh air and stamp the gorgeous surroundings before turning around to head back to the fort</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is one of the most popular locations in Cork City for running and walking. Located just 3 kms east of the city centre, most of the route is on public walkways and is mostly free of traffic. It has largely flat with nice scenic views out over the river and harbour areas. Very easy to navigate as you are either following the river or staying on the public walkways. The route is shared with cyclists, walkers, runners and dog walkers but is wide and easy to traverse despite multiple activies taking place along the route. This is a perfect way to get out in the city while still enjoying fresh air away from city traffic.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">University Walk</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The University Walk traces the development of Cork from
          its medieval marshy roots, to the expansion of the City as
          a prosperous hub of industry and commerce. It emphasises
          the special bonds between ‘town and gown’, exploring
          associated institutional buildings and the centre of
          learning in the region, University College Cork (UCC).
          In addition this walk engages with the “Green” element
          of the City. The University Walk weaves it way through
          Bishop Lucey Park, the formal lawns of the UCC campus,
          and the gardens of Fitzgerald’s Park before strolling
          through the leafy shade of the Mardyke. It also meanders
          along Slí Cumman na mBan, which showcases the wildlife
          and natural splendour of the River Lee and the breadth of
          biodiversity still present in the heart of City.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Oldcourt or sometimes referred to locally as Garryduff, is a mixed woodland of approximately 26 hectares, located close to the southern suburbs of Cork city, namely Rochestown and Douglas. It has historical links back to eminent families from Cork such as the Ronaynes, Goolds and O’ Sheas. Notable features include walls and some old ruins associated with the adjoining estate and a number of small streams that flow through the woodland on their way out to Cork Harbour.

          There are significant sections of old broadleaved woodland to be found throughout the property along with stands of conifer trees at the southern end. There are some wonderful mature specimen Horse Chestnuts and Sycamore along the verges of the forest tracks that traverse the woods.
          
          A surprising find so close to the city. Enjoy!</p>
